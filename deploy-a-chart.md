# Deploy some charts from TAC

* First we set up the TAC repo as a target for helm
* Then we install mariadb and wordpress
  * First walk through the values yaml for each chart
  * Then override some settings so we can connect wordpress tot he maria db
* That's it, we can checkout the svc and log into wordpress later
